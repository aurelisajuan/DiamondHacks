### Inspiration
Today’s web is full of hidden threats—phishing scams, data leaks, and overreaching permissions. But most users don’t read the fine print. In fact, 62% never change app or website permissions after first use. This puts millions at risk, especially those who aren't tech-savvy.
Inspired by the need for simple, accessible cybersecurity, SecWay is an AI-powered Chrome extension that demystifies digital privacy.

### What It Does
SecWay acts as a lightweight, always-on browser companion that helps users see and understand when websites or extensions are asking for too much.
Key features include:
- **Real-Time Privacy Scanner**: Detects risky permissions, overreaching data requests, and suspicious website behavior.
- **AI-Powered Privacy Guidance**: GPT-4 provides human-friendly explanations and smart recommendations—no technical knowledge needed.
- **Educational Nudges**: “Did You Know?” style insights explain why a permission could be dangerous, tailored to user behavior and comfort level.
- **Risk Indicators**: Simple visual privacy ratings appear as you browse—green (safe), orange (review), red (danger).
- **Secure Me Button**: One-click cleanup: the AI suggests safe permission defaults and lets users apply them instantly.

### Challenges We Ran Into
- Balancing Simplicity and Depth – Making the experience clear for non-tech users while still delivering powerful analysis.
- Local-Only Architecture – Avoiding a backend while supporting intelligent features required smart use of APIs and browser-native logic.
- Phishing Detection Accuracy – Tuning ML models to detect threats without false positives or missing subtle scams.

### Accomplishments We're Proud Of
- No Backend, No Data Collection – Privacy-first by design. Everything runs locally or uses anonymous queries.
- Modular Architecture – Easy to extend to other browsers (like Firefox/Edge) and platforms.
- Conversational UX – GPT-4-powered assistant speaks like a human and educates while protecting.
- One-Click Protection – Users can instantly clean up permissions with AI suggestions.

### What We Learned
- User-Centric Security Design – Making cybersecurity understandable builds more trust than fear-based tactics.
- Conversational AI in Extensions – Leveraging GPT-4 in the browser opens up powerful possibilities for live education.
- Interoperability of APIs – Combining public APIs like Google Safe Browsing and PhishTank enabled real-time risk assessment.

### What's Next for SecWay
- Firefox & Edge Support – Extend protection beyond Chrome.
- School + Library Outreach – Partner with public orgs to build privacy awareness from the ground up.
- Scam Detection Leaderboard – Community-reported scam sites for public good.
- Mobile Browser Privacy Tips – Companion tips for smartphone users.
- Parental Control Mode – Help families monitor and protect kids’ browsing.
- Smarter Threat Intelligence – Improve phishing detection using continual model updates.
